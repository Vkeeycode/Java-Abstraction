# Java-Abstraction
Abstraction in Java is a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that hides the complexity of the code and shows only the essential features to the user. 
It is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces, such as abstract class Animal { abstract void makeSound(); }.
Abstraction is also a powerful tool in Java, enabling us to hide the complex details of how code works and present only the necessary features to the user. 
It’s a crucial part of Java’s appeal, making code easier to read, write, and maintain.
